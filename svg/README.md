# Use of text based SVGRenderer

There is branch https://github.com/linev/three.js/tree/text2svg with specialized text-based SVGRenderer  
It is much faster then create normal DOM elements. Was not accepted for three.js. 

I keep here demos how to use them. 
In JSROOT now there is other workaround wich emulates DOM components, but accumulates text representation behind.


# Image embeding in SVG

See example `svg_image.htm`
